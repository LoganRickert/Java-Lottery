This project picks three random numbers between 1 and 10 and then asks the 
user for 3 numbers between 1 and 10. If the user gets all three numbers
correct in the exact order, they win $10,000. If the user gets 3 correct,
but not in the correct order, they win $5,000. If they get 1 or 2 correct,
they get $1,000 or $2,000 respectfully.

If you pick none correct, you lose $1,000. If you have no money left, you
lose.
